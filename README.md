CPU Scheduling Simulator ðŸš€
Summary
The CPU Scheduling Simulator is developed to simulate and compare different CPU scheduling algorithms in a controlled lab environment. The program allows the observation of the decisions made by operating systems and the comparative analysis of the efficiency of different algorithms based on various performance measures.

Stressing adaptability and genuineness, the simulator supports the integration of legacy algorithms combined with advanced scheduling mechanisms, thus enabling scholarly work and experimental assessment of performance.

Primary Attributes

âœ… Simulates different algorithms for CPU scheduling:

First Come, First Served (FCFS)

Shortest Job First (SJF)

Round Robin (RR)

Priority Scheduling

Recently Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) was added.

Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) 

âœ… Evaluates key performance metrics:

Mean Latency Duration (MLD)

Mean Response Time (MRT)

CPU utilization percentage

Throughput (Processes per Second)

Latency Duration 

Use of tables and charts makes visual comparisons unambiguous.

âœ… Designed for easy testing across simple, complex, and edge-case scenarios.
