CPU Scheduling Simulator
Summary
This project is a CPU scheduling simulator, with the purpose of comparing the effectiveness of different scheduling algorithms under different workloads. It is designed to mimic real operating system functionality, thus allowing determination of the best scheduling methods according to various performance metrics.

The simulator has the ability to run the following algorithms:

First Come, First Served (FCFS)

Shortest Job First (SJF)

Round Robin (RR)

Priority Scheduling

Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) (newly implemented)

Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) (newly implemented)

Features

Simulation of different CPU scheduling strategies.

Measurement and evaluation of key performance indicators:

Mean Waiting Time (MWT)

Mean Turnaround Time (MTT)

CPU Usage (%)

Throughput (Processes per Second)

Response times (optional)

Support for both small-scale and large-scale workloads.
